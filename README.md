### Crazyflie navigation with RL
This repository is a Pybullet simulation used for training an agent. The agent navigates a Crazyflie drone around obstacles.

The trained agent can be implemented in the real world with [Crazyflie_RL_implementation](https://github.com/Warrevh/Crazyflie_RL_implementation)

It is possible to train the agent with 3 different RL models: DDPG, TD3 and SAC

The repo also contains code to visualize data

This [video](https://youtu.be/sQ9Wo6_et3o) shows the trained SAC model in simulation.

This [video](https://youtu.be/H_XjN5KiZ3w) is the same model but implemented in the lab.
