### Crazyflie navigation with RL
This repository is a Pybullet simulation used for training an agent. The agent navigates a Crazyflie drone around obstacles.

The trained agent can be implemented in the real world with [Crazyflie_RL_implementation](https://github.com/Warrevh/Crazyflie_RL_implementation)

It is possible to train the agent with 3 different RL models: DDPG, TD3 and SAC

The repo also contains code to visualize data
